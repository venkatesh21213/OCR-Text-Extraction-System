# OCR Text Extraction System with OpenCV and Tesseract  
**Automate text extraction from images using robust image preprocessing and OCR techniques.**  

---

## üìå Overview  
This project aims to streamline text extraction from images by combining **OpenCV** for image preprocessing and **Tesseract OCR** for accurate text recognition. It addresses challenges like noisy backgrounds, complex layouts, and manual transcription inefficiencies, offering a scalable solution for organizations and individuals.

## ‚ú® Key Features  
- **Image Preprocessing**: Noise removal, blurring, thresholding, and erosion to enhance text visibility.  
- **Tesseract Integration**: High-accuracy OCR text extraction in 100+ languages.  
- **Handling Complex Images**: Optimized for noisy, low-quality, or multi-layout documents.  
- **Bounding Box Detection**: Draws rectangles around detected characters/words for visual validation.  
- **User-Friendly Workflow**: Easy integration into existing systems via Python and OpenCV.

## üõ†Ô∏è System Architecture  
The system leverages:  
- **OpenCV**: Preprocess images (blur, threshold, erode, noise removal).  
- **PyTesseract**: Python wrapper for Tesseract OCR engine.  
- **Tesseract OCR**: Core text extraction engine.  

**Flow**:  
1. Load and preprocess images with OpenCV.  
2. Apply transformations (blur, threshold, erosion).  
3. Extract text using PyTesseract.  
4. Post-process results and visualize detected text regions.  

## üôè Acknowledgements  
- **Tesseract OCR** by Google.  
- **OpenCV** for image processing capabilities.  
- **PyTesseract** for seamless Python integration.
